[日本語版の `README.md`](https://github.com/online-judge-tools/oj/blob/master/README.ja.md)

`oj` is a command to help solving problems on various online judges. This command automates downloading sample cases, generating additional test cases, testing for your code, and submitting it.

## Screencast

![screencast](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2203128/34708715-568b13c0-f557-11e7-97ef-9f6b646e4776.gif)

## Features

-   Download sample cases
-   Download system test cases
-   Login
-   Submit your code
-   Test your code
-   Test your code for reactive problems
-   Generate input files from generators
-   Generate output files from input and reference implementation

For the detailed documentation, read [docs/getting-started.md](https://github.com/online-judge-tools/oj/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md).

Many online judges (Codeforces, AtCoder, HackerRank, etc.) are supported.
For the full list, see [the table of online-judge-tools/api-client](https://github.com/online-judge-tools/api-client#supported-websites).

## How to install

## FAQ

-   Can I use Python (or Rust, D, Java, F#, Haskell, etc.) instead of C++?
    -   Yes. Please use `--command` (`-c`) option if needed. For example, for Python, you can run `$ oj t -c "python3 main.py"`.
-   I usually make one directory per one contest (or, site). Can I keep using this style?
    -   Yes, you can use the `--directory` (`-d`) option or `$ rm -rf test/`. However, we don't recommend this style, because you should make additional test cases by yourself and run stress tests to maximize your rating.
-   Can I download all sample cases of all problems at once?
    -   No, but you can use `oj-prepare` command in [kmyk/online-judge-template-generator](https://github.com/kmyk/online-judge-template-generator).
-   Can I automatically compile my source code before testing?
    -   Yes, use your shell. Run `$ g++ main.cpp && oj t`.
-   Can I automatically submit code after it passes tests?
    -   Yes, use your shell. Run `$ oj t && oj s main.cpp`. By the way, you need to take care of problems whose sample cases are not so strong.
-   Can I remove the delays and the `[y/N]` confirmation before submitting code?
    -   Yes, put `--wait=0` option and `--yes` option to `oj s` subcommand. Of course, we don't recommend this. These options exist for failsafe. For example, please consider a situation where if you save 3 seconds, you will move up 3 places on the standings. In such a case, if you get a penalty of 5 minutes, then you will move down at least 300 places on the standings.
-   Are my passwords stored?
    -   No, your passwords are not stored into any files. This program stores only your session tokens (but of course, they're still credentials). Please read [`onlinejudge/_implementation/command/login.py`](https://github.com/kmyk/online-judge-tools/blob/master/onlinejudge/_implementation/command/login.py).
-   Does the config file exist?
    -   No. You can use your `.bashrc` (or similar files) instead. It's a config file of your shell. Read [man bash](https://linux.die.net/man/1/bash) and write shell aliases or shell functions. For example, if you want to use Python code for tests by default, write `alias oj-test-python='oj t -c "python3 main.py"'` to `.bashrc` and use `$ oj-test-python`.
